There are a few LED and camera solutions out there for the V0 series printers but none of them totally satisfied all of my requirements.  So I decided to make my own.  The goals in mind were:
No hardware to attach to the frame (mostly because I didn't feel like adding nuts to the extrusions)
Tight clip-in fit (there are a couple clip-in solutions, but none were as snug in the rail as I wanted)
Fit extra wide LED strips
Hold Raspberry Pi Camera V2 
Symmetrical Design (can easily put the camera on either side without different STLs)
